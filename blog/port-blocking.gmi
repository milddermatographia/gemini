# My Student Housing is Blocking Ports


I've moved into student housing at my grad school, and immediately noticed I wasn't able to synchronize notes with, or even navigate, my Nextcloud instance. I wasn't really sure what was going on, but using the VPN I had from travel allowed me to access it, so I chalked it up to Nextcloud using some obscure port to transfer files and communicate with their mobile and browser applications. When I tried pulling repos or pushing changes using SSH without the VPN enabled, however, those didn't work either. I'm no internet expert, but port 22 is used pretty often, and this is a technical/engineering oriented university, so I'm surprised their student housing would block such an essential port for development. I guess I'm just keeping my VPN subscription until the end of my degree.
