# Musings on Geas


The presence of a Geas is undeniable. Looming, unaturally thin, and draped in layers of black rags, they glide across the ground, legs locked straight as a scarecrow. As the apparition approaches, details are revealed. Fingers, long and sickled; mask, contorted into a demented grin. One cannot help but recoil in horror as they pass by. Yet, crowds will follow cautiously, for the Geas are most singular in their purpose. Nearby, there is a Hunter who has broken their contract and is about to be eliminated most efficaciously.
