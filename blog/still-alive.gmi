# I'm Still Alive!


Title says it all. I realized it's been almost two months since I've written anything on here, which is a darn shame, because I have a big ol list of topics I just can't get around to. I moved to Switzerland in September for grad school and, while it's been an absolute blast so far, it's also crazy busy. Hopefully, over Christmas, I'll be able to whittle away at my list. Maybe give my impressions so far on living in Switzerland and studying at ETH. Write another short story for worldbuilding. Make an even more cursed sequel to Chicken Pot Pie. Give my impressions on MacOS (yes, I've joined the Dark Side, out of (incorrect) perceived necessity). Pointlessly attack common expressions. Pontificate on random stuff.

I'm excited to work on this again.
