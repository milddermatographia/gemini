# Bears! An Incomplete Mini D&D Adventure


I wrote a mini adventure while in Waterton Lakes National Park for the long car ride home. I don't think I'll have time to fully flesh out the areas, build maps, etc., but I figure'd I'd put it up in case someone wants something to build off of. I can send the LaTeX source if anyone is interested `milddermatographia@gmail.com` in editing it. The template came from here [1].
