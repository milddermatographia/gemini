# Review: The Lighthouse



This movie is weeeird.
For starters, it's a 2019 film which is in black and white and almost square aspect ratio.
For seconds, everything else about it.

The setting is simple: two men are on an island tending to a lighthouse, one old and cankerous, the other young and proud, and explores their relationship.
As the film progresses, cracks begin to show; Winslow begins to have hallucinogenic episodes, and becomes more and more obsessed with discovering why Thomas is so protectiveness of the lighthouse.
I won't add any more details for the sake of keeping this spoiler free, but the film escalates, and does so wonderfully.
It's gritty, it's gross, it's psychedelic, and I can highly recommend it if you're looking for something strange to watch.

5/5
