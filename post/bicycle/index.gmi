# You're Riding Your Bike Wrong



I see this often enough that I feel the need to make a PSA: your bike seat should be at a height that, when at the bottom of the stroke, your leg is almost straight.
If this isn't the case, your seat is very likely too low, or your bike frame is too small.
See this video [1] or any really to see how to fit your bike and seat post properly.
