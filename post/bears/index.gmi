# Bears! An Incomplete Mini D&D Adventure



I wrote a mini adventure while in Waterton Lakes National Park for the long car ride home.
I don't think I'll have time to fully flesh out the areas, build maps, etc., but I figure'd I'd put it up in case someone wants something to build off of.
I can send the LaTeX source if anyone is interested (`milddermatographia@gmail.com`) in editing it.
The template came from here [1].
