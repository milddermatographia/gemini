# Review: Interstellar



Honestly, didn't live up to the hype.
The one shot of the ship going through the wormhole was super cool, the shots of the black hole were kind of underwhelming, and the rest was just meh.
I watched Ad Astra a couple years ago, and "person left alone in a remote location who is secretly evil" feels like an overused trope at this point.
I didn't actually finish the movie; I got to the point where he tries communicating with his daughter and turned it off.
Maybe I'm just not big on space movies in general, maybe time travel rubs me the wrong way.

2/5.
Not a bad movie, and I see why other people might like it, but it's not my cup of tea.
