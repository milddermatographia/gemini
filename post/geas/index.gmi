# Musings on Geas



The presence of a Geas is undeniable.
Looming, unaturally thin, and draped in layers of black rags, they glide across the ground, legs locked straight as a scarecrow.
As the apparition approaches, details are revealed.
Fingers, long and sickled; mask, contorted into a demented grin.
One cannot help but recoil in horror as they pass by.
Yet, crowds will follow cautiously, for the Geas are most singular in their purpose.
Nearby, there is a Hunter who has broken their contract and is about to be eliminated most efficaciously.
