# Don't Abuse your Pets



One of my sisters had the brilliant idea of tying a balloon to our cat's tail.
She (the cat) bolted, ran around the house screaming, went under a bed, and sprayed a massive puddle which she got soaked in before we could remove the balloon.
She spent the rest of the day hiding in a corner.
Please please please take a moment to think about how your pet will react before doing something stupid or goofy, otherwise you might end up casually abusing them.
