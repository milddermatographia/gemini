# Things I Want to Do



I'm still massively naive and optimistic, so here's a list of things I'd like to do at some point or another (or at least take a shot at), in no particular order.
Maybe I'll turn it into a living documente like the hiking doc at some point.

* Build my own legged (quadruped) robot a-la-Boston Dynamics Spot/ANYbotics ANYmal
* Build a torso-mounted robot I can co-drum with
* Write my own CAD software (or at least a super basic one)
* Join a band
* Learn how to sing properly
* Write a book. I don't want to publish it or anything, I just want to take all the disparate ideas I've been accumulating and turn them into something
* Create my own RPG system.
* Run a D&D (or other game system) campaign from start to finish (got about halfway through one before life got in the way)
* Hike a mountain taller than 3000m
* Hike a mountain taller than 4000m
* Climb a mountain taller than 5000m
* Do a week+ trek through remote terrain (either geographically isolated like Torngat or Baffin Island, or somewhere high altitude or challenging enough to thin out the herd)
* Get to the higher bouldering difficulties at the local gym
* Move somewhere closer to nature
* Learn how to make clothes
* Move to the same place as my significant other and finally get to spend with time post-insanity
