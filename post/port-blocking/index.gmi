# My Student Housing is Blocking Ports



I've moved into student housing at my grad school, and immediately noticed I wasn't able to synchronize notes with, or even navigate, my Nextcloud instance.
I wasn't really sure what was going on, but using the VPN I had from travel allowed me to access it, so I chalked it up to Nextcloud using some obscure port to transfer files and communicate with their mobile and browser applications.
When I tried pulling repos or pushing changes using SSH without the VPN enabled, however, those didn't work either.
I'm no internet expert, but port 22 is used pretty often, and this *is* a technical/engineering oriented university, so I'm surprised their student housing would block such an essential port for development.
I guess I'm just keeping my VPN subscription until the end of my degree.
