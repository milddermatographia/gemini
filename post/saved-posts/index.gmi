# My Saved Articles



I posted a while ago [1] that I have a Git repo with all my saved web content.
I figured I'd compile a list of the articles I've kept since starting my little archive, alongside a quick (probably not accurate) description of each.
I've organized the content of each category with my favorites/must-reads of each above the `...` and everything else below, each subset in no particular order.
~~I'll hopefully remember to keep this up to date as I add save more content.~~
I won't add to this post, since it'll be impossible to determine what was added when if looking for new content.
I'll make a V2 if anything in a few months.
