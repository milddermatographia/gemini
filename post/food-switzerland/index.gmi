# Food Prices in Switzerland



A super short teaser for the 4-month retrospective on living in Switzerland; I spent 620 CHF on food this past month; granted, this includes the 70 CHF it costed to buy the baking supplies necessary to make tourtiere and nanaimo bars for a thanksgiving event, but it also excludes the 6 CHF I spent 4 days a week at the university mensa, so it comes out to about the same (and also about matches my average for the previous two months as well).
That 620 CHF converts to about 850 CAD, almost three times as much as I used to spend back in undergrad.
I've been eating chicken with rice and roasted veggies for every supper, and overnight oats or bread and eggs for breakfast, so not exactly rich fare.
It's absolutely bonkers how expensive food here is.
