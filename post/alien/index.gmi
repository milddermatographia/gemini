# I dream of Aliens



A couple years ago, I played Alien: Isolation with my sister and her friend.
We didn't get too far into the game; we definitely encountered the alien and got to a point where it became less scary/suspensful and more annoying.
That said, it certainly didn't stop my amygdala from going haywire at night; I've had alien nightmares every once and a while ever since.
Sometimes the dreams will be months apart, other times back-to-back over nights.
The broad strokes of the story are always the same: I'm in some largely populated area and have discovered an underground of sorts.
The alien(s) show up and try hunting me, so I hide.
They find their way to everyone else and pandomonium insues.
The details change in not-that-relevant ways; sometimes it's an airport, sometimes a mall.

Why did I bother writing this down?
I haven't the faintest idea.
