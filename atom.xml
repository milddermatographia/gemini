    <summary>A big &amp;lsquo;ol list of the hikes I&amp;rsquo;ve done, with a quick description/review for each, updated as I do more hikes.
 2018 Switzerland I visited Switzerland for a week in April while working in Germany.
Shilthorn and Lauterbrunnen - Being a tourist, I had no choice but to visit the Interlaken area. Gorgeous valley, great views while hiking along the cliffs on the Shilthorn side, and the falls were pretty magnificent as well.</summary>

    <summary>My 1st gen surface book became nigh unusable in September 2021 after maybe 4 years of use; the keyboard would continuously disconnect from the tablet (I presume because a loose fit and the pins losing their connection), the screen has some major burn-in issues, the battery life had dropped to almost nothing, and the CPU would struggle to achieve anything. I imagine all this, minus the keyboard issues, were caused by me using it pretty heavily for CAD, programming, and occasional gaming; I get the impression it was never designed to sustain high loads for long periods of time, despite its purported productivity pedigree.</summary>

    <summary>I found this song and was immediately torn. I figure it&amp;rsquo;s both worth sharing and criticizing heavily, so without further ado:
The Good Bringing in an orchestra for this song was a brilliant decision. The strings are emotional and sweeping, the brass is powerful with wonderfully dark downward slide at some points, the bells(?) are such a great touch for the breakdown. Sam pulls out some disgusting low growls that really should have made it on to the original recording.</summary>

    <summary>Idiocracy is the tale of an average man who is cryogenically frozen for 500 years and awakens in a future where he is the smartest person alive. The logic for how the world got to such a point is that smart people stopped reproducing and idiots didn&amp;rsquo;t. While the film has been cricticized for such a simplistic take on evolution and intelligence (see this xkcd comic for a quick summary), it does raise some less simplistic/one-dimensional questions: is there less evolutionary pressure to reduce/block certain genetic traits, and if so, will that lack of pressure result in an increase in traits which were previously culled?</summary>

    <summary>I watched Don&amp;rsquo;t Look Up over Christmas and, while I thoroughly enjoyed it from a cinematic perspective, found that it was probably more mastubatory than revolutionary. Myself and those who I watched it with nodded our heads at the empassioned speeches, laughed at the flagrant real-life stand-ins, and lamented how cynical yet accurate the movie is to the current climate crisis. We finished the movie, felt a vague sense of moral superiority for being in-tune with the dismal state of the universe, and promptly moved on with our lives.</summary>

    <summary>I think I&amp;rsquo;ve found why I became fed up with music as a whole; my music organizing and listening system encouraged over-listening to a given genre.
I had organized my Spotify library into genre-specific playlists; these ranged in granularity, from incredibly course (&amp;ldquo;Pop&amp;rdquo;) to more fine (&amp;ldquo;Metalcore&amp;rdquo; vs &amp;ldquo;Deathcore&amp;rdquo; vs &amp;ldquo;Prog Metal&amp;rdquo;). When I listened to music, I usually chose one of those playlists and let it run its course. This meant that my listening experience was fairly homogenous over a single session; I think this may have led to me being burnt out, hearing the same instruments, tunings, patterns, what have you, again and again.</summary>

    <summary>I moved to Switzerland for grad school back in September, and figured I&amp;rsquo;d take the lull in my schedule (not really, still have projects, oh well) to write about my experience so far. I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely make an updated version of this when I graduated; it&amp;rsquo;ll be nice to compare my final thoughts to how I felt pretty early on.
I&amp;rsquo;ve split this into a few sections. The first is about my program at ETH Zurich; the second is about the university itself.</summary>

I&amp;rsquo;ve been applying for jobs since December of 2019. I figure, it being the two year anniversary of unemployment, I&amp;rsquo;d celebrate by making a diagram and rambling a bit about my experience!</summary>

    <summary>I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve become disillusioned with music in the last month. No matter what I listened to, it just made me irrationally angry. About 3 weeks ago, I deleted my Spotify account and didn&amp;rsquo;t listen to anything for about 2 weeks. Creating a new account and coming back to music, I find I&amp;rsquo;m still not happy with anything I find. I figured I&amp;rsquo;d direct my frustration towards this pointless rant about how some genres of music are stupid.</summary>

The hive is compromised, a force incontestable. Faint visions, smells, the descent, something awry, then fear. Terror. Senseless, turning, bumbling. Something is here. Something is hunting.
Here. Away, drifting from the whole, to the part. Forest, and ahead, a human. Their arrival, silent. Curious. Shared hunger with companions, a suitable meal.</summary>

I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really sure what was going on, but using the VPN I had from travel allowed me to access it, so I chalked it up to Nextcloud using some obscure port to transfer files and communicate with their mobile and browser applications.

 Anything that can possibly go wrong, does.
 On your way to work? You left your phone at home. Trying to get an insurance rep on the phone? It&amp;rsquo;ll take three hours. Unless, of course, you leave the room. In which case, they&amp;rsquo;ll pick up instantly, ask if you&amp;rsquo;re there, then hang up.

Healthy Habits and Consumption vs Production Devices Digital Hygiene is the idea of having healthy computing habits, just like we do in real life.

Every single pair pinches my little toe inwards. They cause my toes to hammer when walking to avoid discomfort.
My father said that my feet are the same width as his, and his fit in normal shoes, so I must just be oversensitive.</summary>

Proggy Froggy One of my siblings is a big fan of Zeal and Ardor and I&amp;rsquo;ve finally managed to get into their stuff a bit. For those not familiar, their music is a hybrid of black metal and slave songs or, as Gagneux, their lead singer, so eloquently put it,

In other words, we (humans as a whole) lack empathy.

 The fiction (movie, book, etc.) must have two women in it who talk to each other about something other than a man. (optionally) both of them are named  A simple test which a surprising number of movies fail. I see the Bechdel test as a primitive method of determining how male-centric a given book or movie is; if something fails the test, it&amp;rsquo;s likely because the cast is mainly male, and women are either under-represented, or exist solely to support the male casting.</summary>

While cauterization and magic can be used to close the wound to avoid bleeding out, this leaves the unfortunate permanence of absence.

Doing so, however, requires rigourously following the steps below to avoid spreading the parasite and/or killing the patient.</summary>
